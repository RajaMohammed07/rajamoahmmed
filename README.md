## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes! You can connect a custom domain to your Lovable project by following these steps:

1. Open your project on [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/9075cbe2-bf8f-4fa1-a021-897a5b86484d).
2. Go to **Share → Publish**.
3. Look for the **Custom Domain** or **Domain Settings** option.
4. Enter your custom domain (for example, `www.yourdomain.com`).
5. Follow the instructions to update your DNS records with your domain registrar:
   - Add a **CNAME** record pointing to your Lovable project URL (e.g., `yourproject.lovable.app`), or
   - Add **A records** if required by the instructions.
6. Save the settings and wait for DNS propagation (can take a few minutes to a few hours).

After DNS propagation, your Lovable project will be accessible from your custom domain.
